IIT BHU TPO Forum Notification
===============================

I am trying to make a script to check if any new notifications have arrived on
the tpo portal.

This is essential because as of now, there is no way to know if any new notice
has arrived on tpo forum, other than manually checking it over and over.

I have no access to their database and would attempt to do it
using some web scripts. Let us see where it goes.

Dependencies
============

1. Requests - http://docs.python-requests.org/
2. BeautifulSoup - http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
3. python-crontab - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-crontab
4. Python-pip - For installation of packages in lib folder for GAE (Only needed
		if deploying to GAE)

For deployment of Google App Engine (GAE)
=========================================

1. Install Google App Engine SDK. Make sure the folder is in PATH.
2. Install libraries to lib folder using pip: `$ pip -t lib install -r requirements.txt`
3. Deploy server locally for checking using: `$ dev_appserver.py path_to_folder`
4. Upload to app engine using: `$ appcfg.py -A app_id update path_to_folder`
