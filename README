IIT BHU TPO Forum Notification
===============================

I am trying to make a script to check if any new notifications have arrived on
the tpo portal.

This is essential because as of now, there is no way to know if any new notice
has arrived on tpo forum, other than manually checking it over and over.

I have no access to their database and would attempt to do it
using some web scripts. Let us see where it goes.

Dependencies
============

1. Requests - http://docs.python-requests.org/
2. BeautifulSoup - http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
3. APScheduler - https://apscheduler.readthedocs.org
4. peewee - https://peewee.readthedocs.org
5. psycopg2 - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2
6. [OPTIONAL] python-crontab - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-crontab

About Postgres
==============

The application has support for using postgres database to store its notices.

For usage of postgres :

1. export DATABASE_URL pointing to the postgres:// of the database
2. Use _db() functions for interacting with the database.

For testing on local system, this works.

	export DATABASE_URL=postgres:///$(whoami)

Deploy
======

This application is currently deployed on Heroku and uses its postgres add-on.

It does not support Google App Engine is not possible because of its restriction
on writing files. Even though a database can be used, write permission is
required to save the html file of the Notice Board.
